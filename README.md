# BlockIt #
#### A simple Windows application firewall ####
-----------
BlockIt is meant to be simple Windows firewall.  The goal is as follows: the user will be presented with a list of applications. They pick an application, click "block", and BlockIt completely blocks that application's web access.  The application can be unblocked by selecting it again, and hitting "unblock". Nothing more, nothing less.

The inspiration for this application came from a Mac application that I cannot, for the life of me, find again.
